# Image_Classification

This is my first project using PyTorch for machine learning in Python.

## Aims

Understand how to implement, train and use a convolutional neural network to classify images.  
Give myself a refresher on Python.
Define my own CNN and use a pretrained network (resnet-18).

## Technology

Python 3.8,  
PyTorch,  
MatPlotLib,    
git LFS

## Usage

Unzip the dataset folder,  
run cat_dog_2.py to categorise the images and output a set of 20 examples also showing the classification certainty.  
You can either select to use the pretrained rensnet-18 network, use a pretrained network defined by me, or retrain either using the training function in the code.
